# Cloudapp-microservices
Here’s a sample README.md for a web application that combines Python, Node.js, and Laravel components, tailored to a monorepo structure. This README provides an overview, installation steps, usage instructions, and descriptions of each service.
# CloudSync Application

CloudSync is a cloud-native, multi-service web application designed to showcase real-time data handling, user authentication, and data processing. Built with a combination of Python, Node.js, and Laravel, it leverages containerization, CI/CD, and cloud deployment to deliver a robust and scalable application.

## Overview
CloudSync consists of three main services:
1. **Data Processor (Python)**: Processes data and performs backend analytics.
2. **Real-Time Service (Node.js)**: Manages real-time data streaming and user notifications.
3. **Authentication Service (Laravel)**: Provides authentication, user management, and serves the front-end UI.

These services are containerized using Docker, orchestrated for local development with Docker Compose, and deployed to Azure with CI/CD pipelines managed via GitHub Actions.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), Node.js (Express)
- **Frontend and Authentication**: PHP (Laravel)
- **Containerization**: Docker, Docker Compose
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Cloud Deployment**: Azure
- **Code Quality and Testing**: SonarCloud, pytest, Mocha, PHPUnit

## Getting Started
To run CloudSync locally, you’ll need:
- **Docker**
- **Git**

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CloudSync.git
cd CloudSync
Services
Data Processor (Python)
The Data Processor service handles backend data processing and analytics. Built with Flask, it exposes a REST API for processing incoming data.

Directory: data-processor/
API Endpoints:
POST /process: Process and analyze data.
GET /status: Returns the service status.
Real-Time Service (Node.js)
This Node.js service manages real-time data streaming, using WebSocket connections for live updates and notifications.

Directory: real-time-service/
Endpoints:
WS /connect: Establishes WebSocket connections.
Authentication Service (Laravel)
The Laravel-based service handles user authentication, registration, and the front-end UI.

Directory: authentication-service/
API Endpoints:
POST /login: Authenticate user.
POST /register: Register a new user.
GET /profile: Fetch user profile data.
Running with Docker
The application is containerized for easy setup and deployment. Use Docker Compose to run all services locally.

Build and run all services with Docker Compose:
docker-compose up --build
Access services:

Authentication Service (Laravel): http://localhost:8000
Real-Time Service (Node.js): http://localhost:3000
Data Processor (Python): http://localhost:5000
Deployment
This application is designed for deployment to Azure App Services. The deployment process is automated with GitHub Actions, pushing Docker images to Azure Container Registry (ACR) and deploying them to App Services.

CI/CD
GitHub Actions is set up for:

CI Pipeline: Builds, tests, and runs quality checks for each service on pull requests.
CD Pipeline: Automates deployment to Azure on merges to the main branch.
SonarCloud integration ensures code quality with an enforced minimum of 80% code coverage for all services.
This README gives an overview of CloudSync’s purpose, structure, and setup instructions for local development and deployment. For further details on each component, see the individual README files in each service directory.

This README provides a solid overview for users and developers to understand, run, and contribute to the project. Each service should have its own README for more detailed instructions specific to that component. Let me know if you'd like those too!
